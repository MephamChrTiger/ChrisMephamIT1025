#### Internet Architecture 
##### Internet Protocol 
A) An Internet Protocol address is a label consisting of numbers assigned to each device connected to the internet for communication. An IP address serves two main functions: host or network interface identification and location addressing. IPv4 was the first version of IP, and uses a 32-bit address scheme allowing to store 2^32 addresses which is more than 4 billion addresses. IPv6 is the most recent version of the Internet Protocol. This new IP address version is being deployed to fulfill the need for more Internet addresses. It was aimed to resolve issues which are associated with IPv4. With 128-bit address space, it allows 340 undecillion unique address spaces.

C) The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers is a nonprofit organization responsible for coordinating the maintenance and procedures of several databases related to the namespaces and numerical spaces of the Internet, ensuring the network's stable and secure operation

#### TCP/IP
##### Internet Architecture

A) The Transmission Control Protocol is responsible for ensuring the reliable transmission of data across Internet-connected networks. TCP checks packets for errors and submits requests for re-transmissions if any are found. TCP is a peer-to-peer, connection-oriented protocol. There are no master/slave relations. The applications, however, use a client/server model for communications. A server is an application that offers a service to internet users; a client is a requester of a service. An application consists of both a server and a client part, which can run on the same or on different systems.

i) Layers are important to changing technology because any of the layers/tasks can be changed without affecting the other layers. 

ii) The application layer provides full end-user access to a variety of shared network services for efficient OSI model data flow. This layer has many responsibilities, including error handling and recovery, data flow over a network and full network flow. It is also used to develop network-based applications. More than 15 protocols are used in the application layer, including File Transfer Protocol, Telnet, Trivial File Transfer Protocol and Simple Network Management Protocol.

##### Internet Security
A) HTTP means HyperText Transfer Protocol. HTTP is the underlying protocol used by the World Wide Web and this protocol defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and what actions Web servers and browsers should take in response to various commands. The HTTP protocol is a request/response protocol based on the client/server based architecture where web browsers, robots and search engines, etc. act like HTTP clients, and the Web server acts as a server.

B) Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure is an extension of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). It is used for secure communication over a computer network, and is widely used on the Internet. In HTTPS, the communication protocol is encrypted using Transport Layer Security 

##### Securing Your Web Browser
A) Not securing your web browser can lead quickly to a variety of computer problems caused by anything from spyware being installed without your knowledge to intruders taking control of your computer. Ideally, computer users should evaluate the risks from the software they use.

B) JavaScript, also known as ECMAScript, is a scripting language that is used to make websites more interactive. There are specifications in the JavaScript standard that restrict certain features such as accessing local files. The ability to run a scripting language such as JavaScript or VBScript allows web page authors to add a significant amount of features and interactivity to a web page. However, this same capability can be abused by attackers. The default configuration for most web browsers enables scripting support, which can introduce multiple vulnerabilities.

####  Internet Programming 
##### World Wide Web Consortium
A) W3C is led by Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web and Director and Dr. Jeffrey Jaffe, W3C CEO. They are supported by a staff of technical experts who help coordinate technology development and manage the operations of the Consortium. The W3C mission is to lead the World Wide Web to its full potential by developing protocols and guidelines that ensure the long-term growth of the Web. Below we discuss important aspects of this mission, all of which further W3C's vision of One Web.

B) The social value of the Web is that it enables human communication, commerce, and opportunities to share knowledge. One of W3C's primary goals is to make the benefits available to all people, whatever their hardware, software, network infrastructure, native language, culture, geographical location, or physical or mental ability.

####  HTML5 and CSS
For my web page I wanted to write about a subject that means a lot to me, tigers in the wild, or more specifically, the south chinese bengal tiger. Wild tigers are mostly thought to be extinct in the world unfortunately, but the world wildlife fund does such amazing work protecting tons of species and their habitats and raising cubs to be brought into the wild once again. They have programs where you can adobt a tiger, or any species of your choosing to help the foundation significantly. The tiger is at the top of the food chain in the wild and thus plays a critical role in the overall function of the ecosystem. Tigers are also a vital link in maintaining the rich biodiversity of nature. If we successfully protect just one tiger, we also protect around 25,000 acres of forest. For the title, background, and borders I used a mix of oranges to help strengthen the picture of the southern chinese tiger in the center of the image. I embeded a link to the WWF page on southern chinese tigers in he image, and centered the image on the page using css, so that it is the thing you see the most.
