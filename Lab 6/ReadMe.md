##### Internet Protocol 
A) An Internet Protocol address is a label consisting of numbers assigned to each device connected to the internet for communication. An IP address serves two main functions: host or network interface identification and location addressing. IPv4 was the first version of IP, and uses a 32-bit address scheme allowing to store 2^32 addresses which is more than 4 billion addresses. IPv6 is the most recent version of the Internet Protocol. This new IP address version is being deployed to fulfill the need for more Internet addresses. It was aimed to resolve issues which are associated with IPv4. With 128-bit address space, it allows 340 undecillion unique address spaces.
