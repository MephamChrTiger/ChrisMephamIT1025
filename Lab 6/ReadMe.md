#### Internet Architecture 
##### Internet Protocol 
A) An Internet Protocol address is a label consisting of numbers assigned to each device connected to the internet for communication. An IP address serves two main functions: host or network interface identification and location addressing. IPv4 was the first version of IP, and uses a 32-bit address scheme allowing to store 2^32 addresses which is more than 4 billion addresses. IPv6 is the most recent version of the Internet Protocol. This new IP address version is being deployed to fulfill the need for more Internet addresses. It was aimed to resolve issues which are associated with IPv4. With 128-bit address space, it allows 340 undecillion unique address spaces.

C) The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers is a nonprofit organization responsible for coordinating the maintenance and procedures of several databases related to the namespaces and numerical spaces of the Internet, ensuring the network's stable and secure operation

#### TCP/IP
##### Internet Architecture

A) The Transmission Control Protocol is responsible for ensuring the reliable transmission of data across Internet-connected networks. TCP checks packets for errors and submits requests for re-transmissions if any are found. TCP is a peer-to-peer, connection-oriented protocol. There are no master/slave relations. The applications, however, use a client/server model for communications. A server is an application that offers a service to internet users; a client is a requester of a service. An application consists of both a server and a client part, which can run on the same or on different systems.

i) Layers are important to changing technology because any of the layers/tasks can be changed without affecting the other layers. 

ii) The application layer provides full end-user access to a variety of shared network services for efficient OSI model data flow. This layer has many responsibilities, including error handling and recovery, data flow over a network and full network flow. It is also used to develop network-based applications. More than 15 protocols are used in the application layer, including File Transfer Protocol, Telnet, Trivial File Transfer Protocol and Simple Network Management Protocol.

#### Internet Security
A) HTTP means HyperText Transfer Protocol. HTTP is the underlying protocol used by the World Wide Web and this protocol defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and what actions Web servers and browsers should take in response to various commands. The HTTP protocol is a request/response protocol based on the client/server based architecture where web browsers, robots and search engines, etc. act like HTTP clients, and the Web server acts as a server.
