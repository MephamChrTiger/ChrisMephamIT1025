### Executive Summary

#### File Compression
A) Essentially, there are two main types of file compression, lossless and lossy. Lossless compression takes your files and reduces their size without losing any information. Lossy compression reduces your file size by chopping off bits and pieces that aren't 100% necessary to function. By compressing your documents into one ZIP file, it will take up less space and transfer a lot faster. The recipient just needs to use a program like WinZip to extract the files and they'll have everything you sent them in one, organized folder.

B) The original SVG image file takes up about 24kb on my computer. When sent to a compressed ZIP folder, the size is about 13kb, almost half. 

#### Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
i) Methods are a special kind of function that are defined within a class. The argument to these functions is the word self, which is a reference to objects that are made based on this class. To reference instances of the class, self will always be the first parameter. Defining this class did not create any Shark objects, only the pattern for a Shark object that can be defined later. 

ii) The constructor method is used to initialize data. It is run as soon as an object of a class is instantiated.

iii) Classes are like a blueprint or a prototype that you can define to use to create objects. You can define classes by using the class keyword, just like defining functions by using the def keyword. 

#### Unified Modeling Language (UML)
i) The Object Management Group (OMG) is an international, open membership, not-for-profit technology standards consortium, founded in 1989. OMG standards are driven by vendors, end-users, academic institutions and government agencies. OMG Task Forces develop enterprise integration standards for a wide range of technologies and an even wider range of industries. According to UML, omg defines this as providing system architects, software engineers, and software developers with tools for analysis, design, and implementation of software-based systems as well as for modeling business and similar processes. 

ii) An object is an instance of a class. This is the realized version of the class, where the class is manifested in the program. A class is a blueprint created by a programmer for an object. This defines a set of attributes that will characterize any object that is instantiated from this class. Through the process of abstraction, a programmer hides all but the relevant data about an object in order to reduce complexity and increase efficiency. Inheritance is where the mechanism of basing an object or class upon another object. Encapsulation binds together the data and functions that manipulate the data, and that keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse.
