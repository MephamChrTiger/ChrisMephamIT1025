### File Compression
A) Essentially, there are two main types of file compression, lossless and lossy. Lossless compression takes your files and reduces their size without losing any information. Lossy compression reduces your file size by chopping off bits and pieces that aren't 100% necessary to function. By compressing your documents into one ZIP file, it will take up less space and transfer a lot faster. The recipient just needs to use a program like WinZip to extract the files and they'll have everything you sent them in one, organized folder.

B) The original SVG image file takes up about 24kb on my computer. When sent to a compressed ZIP folder, the size is about 13kb, almost half.
