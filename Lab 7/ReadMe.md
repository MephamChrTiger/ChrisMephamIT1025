#### File Compression
A) Essentially, there are two main types of file compression, lossless and lossy. Lossless compression takes your files and reduces their size without losing any information. Lossy compression reduces your file size by chopping off bits and pieces that aren't 100% necessary to function. By compressing your documents into one ZIP file, it will take up less space and transfer a lot faster. The recipient just needs to use a program like WinZip to extract the files and they'll have everything you sent them in one, organized folder.

B) The original SVG image file takes up about 24kb on my computer. When sent to a compressed ZIP folder, the size is about 13kb, almost half. 

#### Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
i) Methods are a special kind of function that are defined within a class. The argument to these functions is the word self, which is a reference to objects that are made based on this class. To reference instances of the class, self will always be the first parameter. Defining this class did not create any Shark objects, only the pattern for a Shark object that can be defined later. 

ii) The constructor method is used to initialize data. It is run as soon as an object of a class is instantiated.

iii) Classes are like a blueprint or a prototype that you can define to use to create objects. You can define classes by using the class keyword, just like defining functions by using the def keyword.
