#### Python IDLE
    The Shell is the Python command line, and the shell script is the file which is executed that contains what you would put into the command line (or shell). Creating these shell scripts need something called an editor, and one of the most common editors you have probably used in the past, is called Windows Notepad. 

#### Code Examples
        A variable is like a box in the computer's memory where you can store single items. An assignment statement has a variable name, an equal sign, and the value you want to be stored. If you enter the assignment statement spam = 42, then a variable named spam will have the integer value 42 stored in it. A function is a set of statements that take inputs, do some specific computation and produces output. The idea is to put some commonly or repeatedly done task together and make a function, so that instead of writing the same code again and again for different inputs, we can call the function. The three data types are integers, floating point numbers, and strings.
