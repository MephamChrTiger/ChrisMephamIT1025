#### Python IDLE
    The Shell is the Python command line, and the shell script is the file which is executed that contains what you would put into the command line (or shell). Creating these shell scripts need something called an editor, and one of the most common editors you have probably used in the past, is called Windows Notepad. 

#### Code Examples
        A variable is like a box in the computer's memory where you can store single items. An assignment statement has a variable name, an equal sign, and the value you want to be stored. If you enter the assignment statement spam = 42, then a variable named spam will have the integer value 42 stored in it. A function is a set of statements that take inputs, do some specific computation and produces output. The idea is to put some commonly or repeatedly done task together and make a function, so that instead of writing the same code again and again for different inputs, we can call the function. The three data types are integers, floating point numbers, and strings. 
        
#### Graphics
        A) The difference between vector and raster graphics is that raster graphics are composed of pixels, while vector graphics are composed of paths. A raster graphic, such as a gif or jpeg, is an array of pixels of various colors, which together form an image. Vector graphics are best for printing since it is composed of a series of mathematical curves. As a result vector graphics print crisply even when they are enlarged.
        
        B) Lossy compression is the method which eliminate the data which is not noticeable. The lossy compression technique does not restored the data in its original form, after decompression on the other hand lossless compression restores and rebuilt the data in its original form, after decompression. 
        
        C) PNG is the largest image type for bigger images, often containing information you may or may not find useful, depending on your needs. 8-bit PNG is an option, but GIF is smaller. Neither are optimal options for photography, as JPG is much smaller than lossless PNG with only minimal loss of quality. And for storage of high resolution files, JPG compresses to tiny proportions, with quality loss only visible on close inspection.
