### Summary
   This lesson consists of the python IDLE uses and explinations, including a small hello program and demo. The intro to python is very well explained with examples. This lesson also has graphics part, where explained is the differences between vector and raster graphics as well as compression methods and types of images such as PNG, JPEG, and GIF. Last, there is the section on file properties where I created my own logo, DriveTigers, which is about saving users' data in case of a drive failure, and everything about my file is explained there.

#### Python IDLE
    The Shell is the Python command line, and the shell script is the file which is executed that contains what you would put into the command line (or shell). Creating these shell scripts need something called an editor, and one of the most common editors you have probably used in the past, is called Windows Notepad. 

#### Code Examples
        A variable is like a box in the computer's memory where you can store single items. An assignment statement has a variable name, an equal sign, and the value you want to be stored. If you enter the assignment statement spam = 42, then a variable named spam will have the integer value 42 stored in it. A function is a set of statements that take inputs, do some specific computation and produces output. The idea is to put some commonly or repeatedly done task together and make a function, so that instead of writing the same code again and again for different inputs, we can call the function. The three data types are integers, floating point numbers, and strings. 
        
#### Graphics
        A) The difference between vector and raster graphics is that raster graphics are composed of pixels, while vector graphics are composed of paths. A raster graphic, such as a gif or jpeg, is an array of pixels of various colors, which together form an image. Vector graphics are best for printing since it is composed of a series of mathematical curves. As a result vector graphics print crisply even when they are enlarged.
        
        B) Lossy compression is the method which eliminate the data which is not noticeable. The lossy compression technique does not restored the data in its original form, after decompression on the other hand lossless compression restores and rebuilt the data in its original form, after decompression. 
        
        C) PNG is the largest image type for bigger images, often containing information you may or may not find useful, depending on your needs. 8-bit PNG is an option, but GIF is smaller. Neither are optimal options for photography, as JPG is much smaller than lossless PNG with only minimal loss of quality. And for storage of high resolution files, JPG compresses to tiny proportions, with quality loss only visible on close inspection.

#### File Properties
        My image was inspired by the company DriveSavers because of the incredible work they do to save all types of drives for people who may have had a fire or a bomb in afghanistan, etc. This logo used around 47 layers of shapes and text to create. The file takes up 26kb of data in SVG format and defaults to internet explorer. The better program would be chrome or firefox (or anything else because internet explorer isn't the best option). 
        
  ### Conclusion
   In this lab I found a lot of things interesting, and what I learned the most was about image compression and types of graphics such as vector and raster graphics and their uses. Even though I already knew the image types, it was good review to learn what they are each used for the best. Lastly creating my own logo was fun because I do like art, even if I'm not the best at it, it took a while to make since I really wanted it to turn out well and how I wanted, and I am happy with it.
