#### Lucidchart
    Lucidchat is a really easy and simple to use website that makes creating flowcharts and graphs a breeze. Usually creating a complicated flowchart took time and effort and planning and sometimes without instruction. Flowchart makes that process really easy and guided for each user based on their needs/wants and creating my flow chart was very simple and fast. 


###  Introduction to Networking 
#### Data Transmission
    Everything you do on the internet involves and uses packets, for example, each email you send leaves a series of packets and every website you visit comes in a series of packets. Packets are certain sizes of bytes that the network breaks down. Packet switching is the approach used by some computer network protocols to deliver data across a local or long-distance connection. An example of a packet-switching protocol is an IP Address. A protocol is a system of rules that allow two or more itmes of a communications system to transmit information via any kind of variation of a physical quantity. An Internet Protocol address (or IP address) is a label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses it for communication. An IP address serves two main functions: host or network interface identification and location addressing. The Domain Name System (or DNS) is a decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network.

####  Network Hardware
    A) Switches are successor of Hubs. Hubs were literally dumb devices they didnâ€™t provide any security nor do they store any MAC addresses. So, the switch were introduced to overcome these issue, Switch is a device used on a computer network to physically connect devices together. Multiple cables can be connected to a switch to enable networked devices to communicate with each other. Switches manage the flow of data across a network by only transmitting a received message to the device for which the message was intended, and so creates a more secure network and connection. 
    B) A router is a more sophisticated device than a switch. Traditional routers are designed to join multiple area networks (LANs and WANs). Routers serve as intermediate stops for network traffic. They receive packets, look inside each packet to identify the source and target IP address, then forward these packets as needed. 
    
#### Network Topologies
    A) There are a number of reasons why bus topologies are used in smaller networks. One of the main reasons is that they keep the layout simple. the main huge problem with this is that relying on one cable means that topologies have a single point of failure. If the cable fails then the entire network will go down. Ring topologies are very vulnerable to failure, as the failure of one node can take the entire network out of operation. This means that ring topology networks need to be constantly managed to ensure that all nodes are in good health. Though star topologies may be relatively safe from failure, if the central node goes down then the entire network will go down.
    B) A wireless mesh network (WMN) is a communications network made up of radio nodes organized in a mesh topology. Wireless mesh networks often consist of mesh clients, mesh routers and gateways. Meanwhile infrastructure wireless topology is commonly used to extend a wired LAN to include wireless devices.APs are not mobile and have to stay connected to the wired network; therefore, they become part of the wired network infrastructure thus the name. In infrastructure wireless networks, there might be several access points providing wireless coverage for a large area or only a single access point for a small area such as a single home or small building.
    
#### Network Design 
    My network design is a model of the LAN topology network diagram, where I had more of a cellular topology that relies on the location of wireless media hubs and switches. Troubleshooting is easy because each hub or switch interacts independently with each device. A cellular installation depends on the accessibility hub locations.
    
#### NSA/CSS 
    The NSA is the world leader in cryptology, which is the art and science of making and breaking codes. Through the technology and incredible people working for the NSA that allows them to accomplish the goals of discovering our enemies's secrets, protecting U.S. secrets, and outsmarting them in cyberspace while at the same time protecting the privacy rights of the American people.
