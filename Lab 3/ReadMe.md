## Summary


#### Software
  
    The operating system provides multiple important systems such as managing computer hardware, providing user components, and creating a platform that programmers can use to create applications. Every single computer and device runs on an operating system (such as Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, IOS, and android). After the operation system comes the applications software, which allows the user to execute a goal or accomplish a purpose. For example, if you had to create a presentation for a class, you would use Microsoft's PowerPoint. If you wanted to listen to music as another example, you would use iTunes or youtube in your browser. A subcategory of application software is utility, that includes software that allows you to fix or change your computer's software in some way. A great example of a utility would be an antivirus for deleting malware, or disk fragmentation software to help repair or speed up your hard drives. 

#### ERP Software

    ERP software, or enterprise resource planning system, was developed in the late 1990s to help the need to bring an organization's information back under centralized control. ERP software is really just an applicaiton utilizing a central database that is implemented throughout the entire organization. That might sound a little confusing but it is easier than it sounds; it is used by many employees of the company, each user needs to save and edit information from the same data source, and it covers all of the essential applications needed for that business. 

#### Virtualization

    Virtualization came into view back when many IT organizations deployed multiple servers, and x86 servers had limitations such as thier capacity and excessive operation costs. Virtualization relies on software to simulate hardware such as another operating system, all on a single server. The benefits of this software vs multiple servers includes economies of scale and greater efficiency. Something that you might have heard before is this software called a Virtual Machine (VM). A VM is a isolated software container with an operating system and application inside A huge benefit of this software is having multiple VMs on a single computer enables multiple operating systems and applications to run on just one physical server or host. This means that instead of buying 5 computers for 5 users, you could just buy one computer, and create 5 virtual machines having the same effect as buying 5 whole computers, but for a lot less cost and more efficiency.
